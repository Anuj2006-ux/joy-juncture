        <h2>Refund & Return Policy</h2>
        <p><strong>Thinking about a return? Did we mess it up?</strong> We're genuinely sorry if something didn't go as expected.</p>

        <p>We currently handle return and refund requests <strong>on a case-by-case basis</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>But what does that mean for you?</strong></p>
        <p>If you have a genuine issue with your order, you're covered.</p>

        <p>We put in our best to ensure quality and smooth delivery... but hey, sometimes things slip through the cracks. If your item is <strong>damaged, defective, or not what you ordered,</strong> just reach out. We've got your back.</p>

        <p className="section-heading">How to reach us:</p>
        <p>📩 <span className="email-orange">carejuncture@gmail.com</span></p>
        <p>📱 DM us on Instagram @joy_juncture</p>

        <p>Once we verify the issue, we'll <strong>send a replacement</strong> right away... no unnecessary hoops to jump through!</p>

        <h2>Damages and Issues</h2>
        <p>Please check your order as soon as it arrives. If there's a <strong>problem with the item...</strong> be it damage, defect, or a mix-up... let us know <strong>within 48 hours</strong> of delivery so we can make it right.</p>

        <h2>Refund Timeline</h2>
        <p>In rare cases where a refund is necessary instead of a replacement:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Please allow <strong>7–10 working days</strong> for us to review your request.</li>
          <li>Once approved, the refund will be processed to your original payment method.</li>
        </ul>

        <p style={{ marginTop: '30px' }}>We are a small team, building with a lot of love. Your support means the world!</p>
        <p>Thank you for being kind and patient with us.</p>

                <h2>Power Cards Overview</h2>
                <p>Power Cards are a game-changer in Dead Man’s Deck. While they carry zero point value, which makes
                    them ideal for scoring, their real power lies in the surprises they unleash when played. Use them
                    wisely, because once played, you can’t take them back!</p>

                <h2>Detailed Power Card Guide</h2>

                <h3>Grave Peek</h3>
                <p><strong>Look at any one of your own cards</strong></p>
                <p>Helps jog your memory and make strategic decisions. Great early in the game to recall forgotten cards
                    or before a risky move.</p>

                <h3>Zombie Glimpse</h3>
                <p><strong>Peek at any one card from an opponent’s hand</strong></p>
                <p>Perfect for planning future memory matches, swaps, or calling out an opponent’s move.</p>

                <h3>Infected Trade</h3>
                <p><strong>Blindly trade one of your cards with one from an opponent</strong></p>
                <p>You don’t get to see either card, it’s a gamble. Use when you think your current hand is worse or
                    when you want to mess with someone’s memory.</p>

                <h3>Brain Swap</h3>
                <p><strong>Look at an opponent’s card, then decide if you want to swap it with one of your cards
                        (without seeing your own)</strong></p>
                <p>Gives you control and information at once. Works best when you remember your hand well and want to
                    lose a high-value card.</p>

                <h3>Shuffle Shuffle</h3>
                <p><strong>Choose any opponent and shuffle the positions of their cards</strong></p>
                <p>You don’t gain much, but your opponent loses track of their card positions.</p>

                <h3>Corpse Swap</h3>
                <p><strong>Swap your entire hand with an opponent, without looking at any cards</strong></p>
                <p>High risk, high reward. If your hand is full of high-value cards, this is your ticket to escape.
                    <em>Pro tip: To keep memory alignment fair, you can even switch seats with the opponent so card
                        positions stay consistent.</em>
                </p>

                <h2>Important Note</h2>
                <p><strong>Power Cards only work when played on your turn!</strong> If you discard a Power Card during a
                    memory match or opponent discard, its ability will not activate.</p>
                <p>And remember, once you play a Power Card, you must use it. No backing out!</p>

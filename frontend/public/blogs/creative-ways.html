            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Dead Man’s Deck is more than just a memory and strategy game… it's a game night banger that can be
                    played in countless ways depending on your group, vibe, and madness level! Here are some of the most
                    fun, twisted, and community-loved alternate modes to keep the game exciting round after round!!</p>

                <h2>1. Standard</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Play one round at a time</li>
                    <li>Everyone calculates their score at the end of the round</li>
                    <li>The player with the lowest score wins the round</li>
                    <li>Great for casual hangouts or quick match</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Optional: Give the winner a prize or let them choose a dare for the loser</p>

                <h2>2. Cumulative score</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fix the number of rounds in advance (e.g., 3, 5, or 7)</li>
                    <li>At the end of each round, everyone notes their score</li>
                    <li>Add up the scores across all rounds</li>
                    <li>Player with the lowest total score at the end wins</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Why it works: Keeps everyone invested till the end. A bad round doesn’t mean game over!</p>

                <h2>3. Money pot</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Everyone adds a fixed amount (e.g., ₹200 or ₹500) into a pot</li>
                    <li>Decide beforehand if you want the pot to go to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The winner of each round (multiple small wins), or</li>
                            <li>The player with the lowest score after a set number of rounds (one big win)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Winner gets the money, the glory, and the pressure next time</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Make sure all players are comfortable before adding stakes!</p>

                <h2>4. Food at stake</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>After multiple rounds, the player with the highest score becomes the “Food Zombie”</li>
                    <li>They have to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Order food for everyone</li>
                            <li>OR serve snacks</li>
                            <li>OR do a fun food-based dare (like recreating a dish for everyone to rate)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ideal for game nights and house parties.</p>

                <h2>5. Large group</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Got 8+ players? No problem!</li>
                    <li>Shuffle two Dead Man’s Decks together</li>
                    <li>Create a mega chaos deck with more cards, confusion, and clashes</li>
                    <li>Rules remain the same, just scaled</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Best for reunions, family nights, or office socials.</p>

                <h2>6. Twist (Score surprise)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Before the game, pick a special number (e.g., 69, 99, or 42)</li>
                    <li>If a player ends up with that exact score after any round:
                        <ul>
                            <li>They win a bonus prize</li>
                            <li>Their score becomes -69</li>
                            <li>OR they can give +10 points to any other player</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>A fun strategic twist that makes players rethink risk-reward choices!</p>

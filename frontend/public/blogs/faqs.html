                <p>If you're playing Dead Man’s Deck for the first time or you're already hooked and just need a rule
                    clarification, this FAQ guide has your back!</p>

                <h2>Basic Gameplay</h2>
                <h3>Can I pick a card from the discard pile and immediately play it?</h3>
                <p>No. You must first swap it with one of your cards. You can only play it in your next turn.</p>

                <h3>Can multiple people discard the same card when one is thrown?</h3>
                <p>No. Only the fastest player’s discard counts. Everyone else must put their revealed card back (which
                    also means your card was seen by others!).</p>

                <h2>Power Cards</h2>
                <h3>When do I get to use a Power Card’s ability?</h3>
                <p>Only when you play it on your own turn. If you discard a Power Card as part of a memory match (i.e.,
                    outside your turn), its ability does not activate.</p>

                <h3>Can I choose not to use a Power Card once I’ve played it?</h3>
                <p>No. If you play a Power Card, its ability must be used, even if it hurts your strategy. <em>Example:
                        If you accidentally play "Corpse Swap", you must swap your entire hand with someone else, even
                        if your current hand is good.</em></p>

                <p>Want to understand what each Power Card does? Read: <a href="power-cards.html">Dead Man’s Deck: Power
                        Cards Explained</a></p>

                <h2>Ending the Game</h2>
                <h3>What if the deck runs out of cards?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>With 2–4 players: The game ends when the deck runs out once</li>
                    <li>With 5–8 players: It ends when the deck runs out twice</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>No one is ending the game. What now?</h3>
                <p>Just follow the rule above. Once the deck depletes (once or twice, depending on group size), the game
                    ends automatically.</p>

                <h2>Scoring</h2>
                <h3>What if someone else has the same score as the person who called “No More a Zombie”?</h3>
                <p>Tough luck for the caller. You must have the lowest score outright (a tie is not enough). If someone
                    else matches your score, you get punished with the highest score on the table.</p>

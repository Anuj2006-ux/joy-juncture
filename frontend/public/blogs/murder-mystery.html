                <h2>100 Employees. 3 Murders. Endless Clues. Zero Boredom!</h2>
                <p>We conducted a large-scale Murder Mystery Game Night for nearly 100 employees, all playing
                    simultaneously.</p>
                <p>To make the experience seamless and interactive:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Everyone was divided into teams of 3</li>
                    <li>Each team received a custom-designed Murder Mystery Case File</li>
                    <li>The objective? Step into the shoes of detectives and crack <strong>The Bloody
                            Inheritance</strong>, a thrilling case file created by Joy Juncture</li>
                </ul>
                <p>What followed was 75 minutes of pure brainwork… mixed with laughter, collaboration, and a whole lot
                    of competitive energy.</p>

                <h2>Why companies love this activity:</h2>
                <p>This wasn’t your usual “team-building activity.” Employees who had never participated in such an
                    experience found themselves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Piecing together clues</li>
                    <li>Debating motives</li>
                    <li>Matching timelines</li>
                    <li>Discussing evidence</li>
                    <li>Working as detectives, not just colleagues</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Teams bonded naturally... not through forced icebreakers, but through shared curiosity and the thrill
                    of cracking a case together. It sparked collaboration, communication, logical thinking, and
                    networking across departments, exactly what every corporate wants from an employee engagement
                    session.</p>
                <blockquote>“This is the smartest employee engagement activity we’ve ever done!!”</blockquote>

                <h2>What makes Joy Juncture’s Murder Mystery format unique?</h2>

                    <li>Encourages participation from even the quietest employees</li>

                <h2>Day 1: Hikes, first impressions & judgy banter</h2>
                <p>We kicked off with a sunset hike to Bahubali Hills, an unfiltered start to an intentionally uncurated
                    group. Later, the real icebreaker began and it wasn’t your usual name-intro-circle!</p>
                <p>We pre-launched our brand-new conversational card game: <strong>Judge Me & Guess</strong>. Designed
                    especially for strangers, this card game rewards your gut instincts. Here, being judgmental is not
                    just allowed… it’s how you win! [Kudos to Karan Batra- the Judgmental King]</p>
                <p>And let’s just say… it was a hit with hilarious assumptions, wild guesses, and inside jokes that
                    travelled through the whole trip!! People opened up in the most unexpected, light-hearted ways… no
                    deep talks, just deep belly laughs!!</p>

                <h2>Day 2: Court52 × Pickle Tournament</h2>
                <p>Our collaboration with Pickle Haus took center court with the launch of Court52, a custom pickleball
                    twist card game by Joy Juncture. We hosted a mini-tournament at Sports Fusion Udaipur, where players
                    used both paddles and brains to win!</p>
                <p>LUKA Originals came on board as our style partner, gifting exclusive tees to the winning team!
                    Court52 is now open for customization for other pickleball communities and sports-led spaces!</p>

                <h2>Udaipur darshan & a game on the go</h2>
                <p>We soaked in Udaipur’s beauty with a day packed with the serene Lake Pichola boat ride, views from
                    City Palace, local food explorations. But the fun didn’t pause on the commute. We created a custom
                    “Bidding War” bus game:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Two teams based on bus rows</li>
                    <li>One person from each team bid how many seconds they'd need to act out a trip-related word</li>
                    <li>The lower bidder acted it out… no words allowed!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It became one of the most engaging and hilarious memory-makers of the trip. Team spirit? Unmatched!
                </p>

                <h2>Late nights, All-Whites & Dead Man’s Deck chaos</h2>
                <p>Despite the 14-hour day, our guests dressed up in all-white (our sundowner theme) for a relaxed
                    evening. But of course… it escalated.</p>
                <h3>Enter: Dead Man’s Deck</h3>
                <p>Our signature memory strategy card game with wild drinking challenge cards. It started with 10
                    people. Then 20. Then all 32 of us, crowded in the resort’s club room, split across 4 tables!</p>
                <p>Final round ended at 2:30 AM 🏆 Champion: Aayush Sawalkar, crowned after 3 intense rounds of
                    gameplay.</p>

                <h2>3AM Salsa + 7AM Sunrise</h2>
                <p>What’s better than card games at 2:30 AM? Salsa at 3AM, led by Mitali Dance. We danced. Swapped
                    partners. Laughed till our cheeks hurt. And when it all slowed down… We watched the sunrise…
                    together!</p>
                <p>A true Haus of Joy moment!</p>

                <h2>Final morning: Goodies for the good souls</h2>
                <p>We wrapped up the experience with personalized goodie bags that included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>JJ custom 'One More Round' jigsaw puzzle</li>
                    <li>A limited-edition Haus of Joy tote</li>
                    <li>A full Court52 deck</li>
                    <li>Chocolate wafer rolls & cones (sponsored by Craveto)</li>
                    <li>Pickle Haus keychain</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Because play doesn’t have to end when the trip does :)</p>
